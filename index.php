                    Parrots, also known as psittacines are birds of the roughly 398 species in 92
                    genera comprising the order Psittaciformes found mostly in tropical and subtropical
                    regions. The order is subdivided into three superfamilies: the Psittacoidea ("true" parrots),
                    the Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and the Strigopoidea (New Zealand parrots). One-third
                    of all parrot species are threatened by extinction, with a higher aggregate extinction risk
                    (IUCN Red List Index) than any other comparable bird group. Parrots have a generally pantropical
                    distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere, as well.
                    The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America and Australasia.
